<strong>Personal Idea (where I have expertise)</strong>

<strong>Bloom.</strong> The AI parenting coach. Crunches every parenting book, every scientific study, everything ever published on raising children - extracts the best strategies for any issue. You talk to the AI, describe what you're dealing with, and it gives you the most effective approaches backed by research.

- Prototype already built
- Behavioral profiling (temperament, strengths, learning style) to personalize recommendations
- Source citations for every strategy
- <strong>Joy</strong> raised $14M at $12/month for generic AI parenting. <strong>Brightline</strong> raised $212M but needs human clinicians. We do personalized guidance without therapist in loop.

<strong>Personal Idea (where I have expertise)</strong>

<strong>Wunderkind.</strong> Voice-based phonics platform teaching kids (3-9) letter sounds with real-time speech recognition feedback.

- Progressive: Listen → Say together → Say independently (AI validates)
- Per-child voice calibration
- Planned pricing: $1-5/month
- Prototype already built
- <strong>Ello</strong> raised $15M, charges $25/month, focuses on reading aloud. <strong>Homer</strong> raised $50M but no voice recognition. We do phoneme-level production at much lower price point.

<strong>AI-Native</strong>

<strong>Soulmate.</strong> Deep AI interview probes your interests, fears, philosophy, values - the longer you talk, the deeper it goes. Matches you with compatible people for any relationship: romantic, best friend, business partner.

- Big Five, attachment styles, values alignment
- <strong>Known</strong> raised $9.7M (voice AI, 80% led to real dates), <strong>Keeper</strong> raised $4M (100+ data points), <strong>Sitch</strong> raised $6.7M
- These all do romantic only. Nobody's doing business partners or friendships.

---

<strong>AI-Native</strong>

<strong>Culture Match.</strong> AI job matching based on values and philosophy, not skills. Deep interviews with both candidates AND companies to find true culture fit.

- Companies hire for skills but retention comes from alignment
- <strong>Mercor</strong> raised $350M, <strong>Dex</strong> raised $3.1M (a16z), <strong>Sapia.ai</strong> raised $25M - but still mostly skills-focused
- Nobody's doing genuinely deep philosophical interviews on both sides.

---

<strong>AI-Native</strong>

<strong>Future of Work.</strong> Chat interface where you describe what you need to do → get matched to human experts who tell you which AI tool to use and exactly how to prompt it. AI caches answers so repeat questions are cheaper. Subscription with credits.

- CEO says "I need a product video" → expert says "Use Runway, here's the workflow and prompts"
- Experts get paid per successful answer
- AI layer routes questions and serves cached answers at lower credit cost
- <strong>SuperMe</strong> raised $6.8M to clone experts like Lenny Rachitsky with AI
- <strong>GLG</strong> has 1.2M experts but charges enterprise rates and isn't AI-focused
- Nobody's doing this specifically for "which AI tool + how to prompt" - that's the gap.

<strong>Crypto / Web3</strong>

<strong>Tokenized Lovable.</strong> Vibe coding platform where projects launch with their own token. Create a project, community funds it through a quick presale, developer gets cash to build. The magic: anyone can contribute code, token holders vote on what gets merged, contributors earn tokens. The more useful the app becomes, the more valuable the token. Aligned incentives - everyone wins when the project succeeds.

- <strong>Lovable</strong> raised $330M at $6.6B - but centralized, no community ownership
- Already have smart contracts, UX design, early prototype

<strong>Personal Idea (where I have expertise)</strong>

<strong>Bloomberg for Retail.</strong> Product is effectively a wrapper + curated data with good prompt engineering.

- Real time portfolio updates
- What top investors are saying about each holding. We define top people by looking at the track record of their public calls.
- Recommender engine: helps you optimize your portfolio based on your constraints, objectives and expertise. If you upload your historical investments, we can recommend ideas based on historical wins and expertise.
- Depending on the tier, I think people will be willing to pay 20-100 bucks/month + brokerage rebates when they transact on an affiliate platform
- Deep dive analysis (I have good prompts for this)

<strong>Ideas from Failed Startups (PMF proven)</strong>

<strong>Mental Health AI Therapy.</strong> Mental health platform with AI therapy + maybe telemedicine consultation partnerships

- <strong>Mindstrong</strong> raised $160M and reached unicorn status trying to use smartphone interaction patterns as mental health biomarkers. They shut down in March 2023 due to inability to prove efficacy and costly human clinicians in the loop.
- <strong>Why AI changes everything:</strong> LLMs are showing promising results in therapy applications—conversational AI can provide 24/7 support between human sessions, dramatically improving per-patient economics. Modern ML can analyze behavioral signals (typing patterns, app usage, sleep) more accurately than Mindstrong's earlier approaches.

<strong>Ideas from Failed Startups (PMF proven)</strong>

<strong>Legal Documents for SMB.</strong> Legal document generation and review for small businesses and startups.

- <strong>Atrium</strong> raised $75.5M from Andreessen Horowitz trying to be a hybrid law firm plus legal software. They couldn't make legal services efficient enough to compete with traditional firms and shut down in March 2020. Founder Justin Kan (Twitch) acknowledged the software didn't deliver sufficient value.
- <strong>Why AI changes everything:</strong> LLMs excel at contract review, legal research, and document generation—the exact capabilities Atrium tried to build with custom NLP that couldn't perform. A platform that gives SMBs and startups direct access to AI legal document assistance bypasses the expensive-lawyer problem entirely.

<strong>Social Media Growth Kit for Influencers.</strong> Not totally flushed out but if we get a sharp Gen Z kid who is an influencer, this could work.

- Very fragmented market with a lot of piecemeal solutions. We can offer a holistic platform.
- I know this is not original idea but there's just very few great products and there's like 100 tools available. I think we can build one great, viral platform

---

<strong>AI-Native</strong>

<strong>Social Media Kit for SMBs.</strong> Same as above but different target market - small businesses instead of influencers.

<strong>AI-Native</strong>

<strong>Corporate Training Videos.</strong> AI-generated corporate training and compliance videos/materials. Already have quite successful AI-empowered incumbents though.

- <strong>Synthesia</strong> reached $100-146M ARR selling AI avatar videos to 70% of Fortune 100 companies.
- <strong>HeyGen</strong> hit $95M ARR and profitability in under 3 years. Corporate training is a $350B+ industry increasingly moving to video.
- I feel we are better for B2C or B2SMB. Selling for corporates need sales team blah blah… can be annoying.
